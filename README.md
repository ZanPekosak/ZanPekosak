Hi!
My name is Žan Pekošak and I am a student of electrical engineering, located in Slovenia. 
I have a passion for building and tinkering with electronics and especially for building 
custom and needlessly complex solutions to very basic problems, many of which already exist 
and far superceed anything I build. This profile was created to enable me to share my projects
with the fantastic open source community, which taught me more than any other school or project
on which I collaborated on. I am looking forward to launching my first projects on here and hopefully
collaborating with the community, as well as learning as much as I can. 

I enjoy tinkering in the following domains:   power electronics, home automation, industrial automation and circuit design.

For general information, suggestions or advise, as well as project or job offers, I am available at my private email address listed on my profile: pekosak.zan@gmail.com
For educational projects, university projects and academic work, you can contact me at my student email: zan.pekosak@student.um.si 
(list your intentions and where you got the email address from in the message. No SPAM on here). Valid until September, 2027, unless otherwise specified. I prefer my personal email.
